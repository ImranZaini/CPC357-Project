// Software Installation
1. Install Arduino IDE and set up a proper library as mentioned in the Software Components for the usage of ESP32 Maker Feather AIot S3 Microcontroller.
2. Navigate to V-One Iot Platform and add a gateway.
3. Install Iot-Kit-V-One-main library from the github and add it from the manage library in the Arduino IDE.
4. In that folder, in vonesetting config file, change the WiFi SSID and  WiFi password of your Wifi, and add the Gateway ID token and its access token.
